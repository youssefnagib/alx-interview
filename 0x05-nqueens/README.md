# 0x05. N Queens

## Description

The N Queens problem is a challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. The goal is to find all possible ways to arrange the queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project implements a solution to the N Queens problem using backtracking.

## Usage

The program is run from the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
$ ./0-nqueens.py N
```
