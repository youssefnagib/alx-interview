# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project focuses on implementing an algorithm to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise **in place**. The goal is to manipulate the matrix directly without using extra memory for a new matrix.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to manipulate 2D arrays.
- Learn about in-place algorithms and their benefits.
- Solve problems involving transformations of data structures.

## Requirements
- Language: Python 3.x
- All files are interpreted and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.x**.
- Code must follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines.
- Use only built-in Python functions and standard libraries.

| `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`  | Contains the function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` for rotating the matrix in place. |

## Function Prototype
```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

    Args:
        matrix (list[list[int]]): The n x n 2D matrix to rotate.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in place.
    """
