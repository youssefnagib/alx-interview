# 0x08. Making Change

## Description
This project focuses on solving the **minimum coin change problem**. Given a pile of coins of different denominations and a total amount of money, the task is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make the change for that amount.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply **dynamic programming** and **greedy algorithms** to solve optimization problems.
- Learn how to handle edge cases in algorithm design.

## Requirements
- All code should be written in Python 3.x.
- Code should follow the **PEP 8** style guide.
- Files should have executable permissions (`chmod u+x`).
